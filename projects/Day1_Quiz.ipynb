    "#### Test your luck: Add a number-guessing question\n",
    "For this question, you will need to use a **while** loop. It is similar to the *for* loop we have seen in lectures, but a *while* loop does something as long as the condition is true. For example, the following code will run as long as the `number` is less than 5:\n",

The guessing continues as long as the user does not enter the number that is equal to `special_number` (while loop can help with this!). If the user guesses the number within 5 attempts they get an extra point.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make things more interesting, you can use the `randint` function which gives you a random number. For that, you need to add the following line at the beginning of your script:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "from random import randint\n",
    "```\n",
    "To use the function, that is, to get a random number between 0 and 9 (inclusive) and store into your `special_number`, add this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "special_number = randint(0, 9)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Store responses on the disk\n",
    "It is possible to store the questions and answers in a text file on your computer, so that you can modify the quiz later without needing to change the code. For this, you need to look up how to read and write from a file in Python! You will need to create a text file and give it a name, store your questions and answers, and close that file. Then you can use Visual Studio Code to open it and take a look at it!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quiz exchange!\n",
    "Exchange your code with the person next to you, and try to solve each other quizzes! If you want to share your quiz with other workshop participants, send an email to our mailing list and attach your name_quiz.py file where name is your name."
