# Congrats! You made it.
## You understand the basics of Python. What’s next?


#### Basics
If you want to rehearse what you learned in the workshop, there are [several Python tutorials](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Programmers) covering basics which walk you through every step:
- Google's Python class: https://developers.google.com/edu/python/
- Automate the Boring Stuff: http://automatetheboringstuff.com/

#### Specific Packages
For plotting:
- Matplotlib: http://matplotlib.org/gallery.html 

For data analysis:
- Pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/
  - Package for advanced data analysis. Use it to read Excel spreadsheets, csv files and many other formats. You can query your data set and look for specific items (e.g. give me all students whose grades are above the average).

Numeric manipulations and scientific computing:
- NumPy: http://www.numpy.org/
  - Good for anything that includes time series and lots of numbers, algebra and any sorts of math
  - If you come from the land of MATLAB, here are equivalent Python commands in NumPy: http://mathesaurus.sourceforge.net/matlab-numpy.html
  - Exercises with Numpy arrays: http://www.labri.fr/perso/nrougier/teaching/numpy/numpy.html
- Scipy: https://www.scipy.org/
  - a bundle of packages for scientific computations (already includes NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib...) 

Machine learning:
- scikit-learn: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/
  - Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis
  
Image processing:
- scikit-image: http://scikit-image.org/

Hardcore web development:
- Django: https://www.djangoproject.com/
 
#### Other programming environments
In the workshop we have used IPython and Visual Studio Code. However, there are plenty of other options when it comes to writing code. These are just some options you might want to take a look at:
- Python Tutor: http://pythontutor.com/
  - Great for visualising your code when something weird happens.
- PyCharm: http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
- Spyder: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spyder_%28software%29
- Jupyter Notebook: http://jupyter.org/
  - the slides we made for the workshop were made in Jupyter Notebook with Python! 

### Advice from Sean:

*What else can I learn about Python and what can I do with it?*

You’ve already learned how to do data analysis and automate boring tasks, but there’s a pretty wide world out there:

- **Object Oriented Programming** to organise your code better.
- **Psychological experiments** (there were a lot of psychologists in this workshop) use [PsychoPy](http://www.psychopy.org/).
- **Brain models** use [Nengo](https://github.com/nengo/nengo) (which Ivana and Sean use every day).

*What about websites and visualisations?*

If you want to make a reactive website or program nice visual things, Although it is good at making static websites, Python won’t help you that much. What you’re looking for is JavaScript, which has a lot of stuff that you’ll recognise from Python. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) has a good interactive tutorial on JavaScript.

*What about videogames?*

Don’t know much about this in Python or in any language. You’ll have to research this on your own. PyGame is good for getting started for sure!

*Where can I get help?*

To get help or to ask general questions about Python, there’s local meetups with [WatPy](http://watpy.ca/) and in Sean’s experience the people in the StackOverflow chat rooms are quite friendly.


HapPy coding! :)
